If you have adobe illustrator, please open the 
cutting board ai file and divide up the pieces
to your liking

If you need to edit individual panel designs, 
please go to Adobe Illustrator Files Folder

If you want to work with SVGs as I have, please refer
to the Glowforge Manual Folder

Sincerely,
Gabriel
